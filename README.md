What is Random Forest Regression?

Random forests or random decision forests are an ensemble learning method for classification, 
regression and other tasks, that operate by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting 
the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees. 
Random decision forests correct for decision trees' habit of overfitting to their training set.

In this project we are building a bluff detector using random forest regression method.
we have a data set, of a company and its employee positions and their annual salaries. 
Human Resources team is about to hire a new employee in the company. 
So, the HR team looking to hire a person. So, a level of letâ€™s say 6.5. Now, the company wants to make an offer to the person, and 
he asks for, more than 160k a year, because he says that, his salary was 160k in the previous company. So, the company asks us to build 
bluff predictor, which can predict if the person is lying. So, we tend to get the dataset (mentioned above), which gives the salary and 
of the level of the position of the employee, where our potential employee, is working currently. So, now we need to build a lie detector 
using random forest regression in python.
